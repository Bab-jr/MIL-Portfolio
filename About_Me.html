                    <h3>
                        I am a self taught programmer who started with python during grade 5, my 
                        interest really started to kick off when I saw some python source code and 
                        thought "hey, that looks cool!"
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        Graduating from <b>Baptist Center Christian School of Iloilo City Inc (BCCSI)</b>
                        I then took the <b>Strengthened Technical Vocational Education Program 
                        (STVEP)</b> here in Iloilo National High School. Originally, there was
                        a specialization offered at STVEP called <u>"electronic technologies"</u> where 
                        we would be taught robotics and programming, but it was dissolved due to 
                        a lack of students who chose said specialization.
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        Never the less, I decided to continue under a different specialization
                        in STVEP: <b>Computer System Servicing (CSS)</b> which was about hardware
                        stuff, all that while continuing to learn python by myself. That all
                        changed in grade 9 however, when <b>programming</b> became a viable
                        specialization in STVEP once again.

                    <h3>
                        Ever since, I have been blazing though creating projects left and right
                        and having already learned programming standards and syntax for years,
                        I had a considerable advantage when compared to my classmates and that
                        gave me enough time to do whatever I wanted to do in programming class.

                        Aside from programming, I don't really have any "hobbies" per se.
                        Which seems weird, but I think I just optimized myself to be the
                        coding machine I want to be. However, just because I like to code
                        doesn't mean its the only thing I do.

                    <h3>
                        If I am not coding, I am playing games on my phone of laptop, there
                        is no alternative. Thats basically all I do: code and play. I don't 
                        study for tests or go out (all that much anyways) and I seem to be
                        perfectly fine. I have been described to have gotten my mother's
                        brain and intellect being far above my age group and being more 
                        interested in the sciences. Which explains a lot as to why I don't 
                        have any other hobbies. Speaking of my mother.

                        Completely independent and smart. As I said before, I am described to 
                        basically be a "male version of my mother" because we both have the 
                        same type of "weirdness" that makes us sound like nerds. But I don't 
                        really care, I personally love being a "nerd" and my mother does as well.

                        also having worked in other countries outside as well. However, she has 
                        returned home for a while due to the pandemic and health concerns but

                        From elementary all the way to the start of grade 9, I actually had no

                        my "friends" at the time would only go to me just so I can either
                        help them in their studies or so they could bully or tease me.
                        That all changed midway through grade 9 however, where I would meet
                        my first real friend: Geon (already mentioned before) as well as 
                        what I would consider to by my forever friend group.

                        sometimes being a substitute for teachers if they couldn't make
