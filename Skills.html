                    <h3>
                        As said before, I am a programmer at heart, learning many different languages
                        ranging from: <u>C++, C#, Java, Python, Web development (HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, SQL)</u>
                        and so on, working on many prototype terminal outputing programs in the past, the 
                        most well known of which is the <b>shapes calculator</b> originally made in python 
                        during christmas break in 2021 and remade in 2024 for the first <b>programming
                        competition in nasyo</b> (both me and my partner for that comp won 1<sup>st</sup>
                        place as well :D)
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        I have also put these skills to the test, creating and modifying games to best
                        suit my enjoyment, these include memory address rewriting and creation of mods
                        (most notably in minecraft where I am currently working on a mod called 
                        "simplier skills" which will release later this year)
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        Aside from programming, I also have some experience in sprite creation, 
                        particularly in pixel art. (the background picture isn't my own btw, I couldn't 
                        find enough time to create original pixel art for this) All while being a very
                        devoted gamer, particularly in strategy and FPS games.
