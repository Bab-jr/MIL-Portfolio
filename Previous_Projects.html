                        programming competition during SY 2024-2025. It was a paired competition

                        and he is in section B, you may know him as Dulaca) we won first place
                        when we were just grade 11 against grade 12 competitors!

                        2024, this small game was to showcase my knowledge in java programming 
                        particularly in a field known as <b>object oriented programming (OOP)</b>
                        where all the elements on the screen are made of objects that can move 
                        and be interacted with in unique ways.

                        my designer friends Sean. (hes not from nasyo) I am hopeful to get a 
                        working beta version of the game up and running by the end of this
                        SY to wrap up my portfolio for collage.
