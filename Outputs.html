                        This is a schematic from one of my unpublished stories made during grade 11.
                        The story itself was centered around a scientist designing a way of producing
                        energy more cheaply for everyone. Thus coming up with a design for a fusion 
                        reactor, being the most efficient way of producing energy estimated to be over
                        a million times more efficient than fossil fuels and about 50 times more efficient
                        than nuclear fusion. 

                        This one in particular was perfect as the topic in MIL was about an invension that
                        could help the school, and I recalled the limitation of charging and use of TVs in
                        classrooms at the start of grade 11 because of how high the electicity bill for NASYO
                        was, hence why I thought this fusion reactor I made a year ago was perfect for the
                        design.

                        where all the elements on the screen are made of objects that can move
